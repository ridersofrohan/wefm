              When you use the Service, we may send one or more cookies &ndash; small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters &ndash; to your device. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser.

Please note that if you delete, or choose not to accept, cookies from the Service, you may not be able to utilize the features of the Service to their fullest potential.&nbsp; We may use third party cookies on our Service as well.&nbsp; For instance, we use Google Analytics to collect and process certain analytics data.&nbsp; Google provides some additional privacy options described at www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/ regarding Google Analytics cookies.

        <p class="sub-section">
          We may also automatically record certain information from your device by using various types of technology, including &ldquo;clear gifs" or &ldquo;web beacons.&rdquo; This automatically collected information may include your IP address or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after you use the Service, the pages or other content you view or otherwise interact with on the Service, and the dates and times that you visit, access, or use the Service. We also may use these technologies to collect information regarding your interaction with email messages, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message. This information may be connected with other information about you.

            <span>
              When you choose to log-in and connect your third party accounts to your Service profile, we collect information from that third party account.&nbsp; For example, when you log-in with your Facebook account, we may collect the information you have made publicly available in Facebook, such as your name, profile picture, gender, networks, age range, language, country, friend list, and any other information you have made public.&nbsp; When you log-in with your Spotify account, we may collect information such as your name, profile picture, music activity (including playlists, top songs, top artists, and other activity). We collect information from such third party account in an ongoing manner so that we can update your profile.

              We may display third-party content on the Service, including content from Spotify. Third-party content may use cookies, web beacons, or other mechanisms for obtaining data in connection with your viewing of the third party content on the Service. Additionally, we may implement third party buttons (such as Facebook &ldquo;like&rdquo; or &ldquo;share&rdquo; buttons) that may function as web beacons even when you do not interact with the button. Information collected through third-party web beacons and buttons is collected directly by these third parties, not by We:fm. Information collected by a third party in this manner is subject to that third party&rsquo;s own data collection, use, and disclosure policies.
