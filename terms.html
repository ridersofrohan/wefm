<p style="margin-left: .3in;">NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICE OR WE:FM ENTITIES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE WE:FM ENTITIES OR THE SERVICE THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS.

<p style="margin-left: .3in;">THE LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS AND DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SECTION APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. We:fm does not disclaim any warranty or other right that We:fm is prohibited from disclaiming under applicable law.</p>

<p style="margin-left: .3in;">EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THESE TERMS. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS.

In the interest of resolving disputes between you and We:fm in the most expedient and cost effective manner, and except as described in Section 15.2, you and We:fm agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND WE:FM ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>

  <p>15.2<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Exceptions. Despite the provisions of Section 15.1, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.</p>

  <p>15.3<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and We:fm will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, &ldquo;AAA Rules&rdquo;) as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at <a href="http://www.adr.org/"><span >www.adr.org</span></a>, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting We:fm. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.</p>

  <p>15.4<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Notice of Arbitration; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (&ldquo;Notice of Arbitration&rdquo;). We:fm&rsquo;s address for Notice is: Golden Music Technologies, Inc., 1035 Campus Drive, Stanford, CA 94305. The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (&ldquo;Demand&rdquo;). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or We:fm may commence an arbitration proceeding. All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or We:fm must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by We:fm in settlement of the dispute prior to the award, We:fm will pay to you the higher of: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator; or (ii) $10,000.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>15.5<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fees. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, We:fm will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Santa Clara County, California but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse We:fm for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator&rsquo;s ruling on the merits.</p>

  <p>15.6<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No Class Actions. YOU AND WE:FM AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and We:fm agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person&rsquo;s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>

  <p>15.7<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Modifications to this Arbitration Provision. If We:fm makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to We:fm&rsquo;s address for Notice of Arbitration, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to We:fm&rsquo;s address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with We:fm will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.</p>

  <p>15.8<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Enforceability. If Section 15.6 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 15 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 15 will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 16.2 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.</p>

Throughout these Terms the use of the word &ldquo;including&rdquo; means &ldquo;including but not limited to&rdquo;. If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.</p>
